# ValidationValse
 Password Validator "ValidationValse" - Group Project by Yannick Mottl, Thomas Neumann and Oliver Olah

   Our goal in this project was to create an artifact which validates passwords based on multiple different factors.

     Some of these factors are the usual password requirements, which everybody has seen before when creating a password for a new e-mail account for example.

        A valid password within our project must meet the following basic requirements:

         - Password must be at least 8 characters long.
         - Password must not contain spaces.
         - Password must not contain sequences of the same character (e.g. "aaa" or "111").
         - Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
         - Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
         - Password must contain at least one digit.

     We also included some custom requirements which a valid password within our project must meet, these are the following:

         - Password must contain the name of a Bundesliga club that is NOT RB Leipzig:
